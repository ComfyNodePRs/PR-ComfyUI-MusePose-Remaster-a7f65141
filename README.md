### Comfyui-MusePose-Remaster

This is a remaster version of the [MusePose comfyui node](https://github.com/TMElyralab/Comfyui-MusePose), that removes dependency of `mmcv` which get conflicts with other nodes, supports Images input, and supports auto download of pretrained weights, to increase the usability of this project.
